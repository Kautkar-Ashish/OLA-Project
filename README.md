‚Ä¢ Business Problem
Ride-hailing platforms like OLA face challenges such as frequent cancellations, uncompleted rides, and varying customer satisfaction. Raw booking data makes it difficult to quickly identify patterns that affect revenue, driver performance, and customer experience.

‚Ä¢ Goal of the Dashboard
To deliver an interactive Power BI dashboard that:
Summarizes booking performance across regions, vehicle types, and time.
Highlights key cancellation reasons and incomplete rides.
Tracks customer and driver satisfaction through ratings.
Supports decision-making to reduce cancellations, improve service quality, and optimize operations.
